  A reducer is a "pure" function that takes in an original state and action,
  and produces a new state (no mutations). Pure means that nothing "random"
  can occur and that nothing that causes side-effects can occur. This means
  you should NOT do the following in a reducer:

  1. Store the current date or time
  2. Make an web callout
  3. Write a file to disk
  4. Interact with any "global" entities

  If you wish to do any of those things, they should occur in an action.
